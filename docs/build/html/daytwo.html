<p>Let&#8217;s start with downloading the data! This is going to take a <em>long</em> time, so we should start here. We will need to navigate to the <a class="reference external" href="ftp://username:password&#64;titan.bch.msu.edu">FTP server</a>. I would recommend plugging into the ethernet and make sure you have at least 10 GB of space on your computer. Initiate the download by right clicking on a sample and clicking on &#8220;Save As&#8221;. Save this file to your Desktop. Eventually we are going to rename this file after we have a refresher on basic Linux/Unix commands.</p>
<p>Before we dig into the data and begin trimming and aligning the reads to the genome, I think it is useful to understand what happens <em>after you submit your RNA to the sequencing facility</em>. This sort of knowledge can be very useful in understanding what could potentially provide bias and any number of issues to the end dataset. In this session we will cover several things including:</p>

<div class="section" id="rna-seq-background-information">
<span id="rnaseqbackground"></span><h2>RNA-seq background information<a class="headerlink" href="#rna-seq-background-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before we begin, let&#8217;s watch a video about how <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=womKfikWlxM">Illumina sequencing works</a>.</p>
<p>This video does a pretty good job explaining how, in generalities the sequencing process works for DNA. So for sequencing RNA, the process is as follows:</p>
<img alt="RNAseq workflow" class="align-center" src="_images/rnaseqworkflow.jpg" />
<p><em>Adapted from: Zhernakova et al., PLoS Genetics 2013</em></p>
<p>So actually, we aren&#8217;t sequencing RNA at all! We are sequencing the cDNA made from the RNA. RNA-seq is a high resolution next generation sequencing (NGS) method to assess the transcriptome of an organism and compare transcriptional changes between organisms/treatments to ascertain specific pathways/genes that are moving in response. But now, let&#8217;s talk about what can add bias to the data and what we do with the data to make sure that it is reasonable to proceed to further analysis steps.</p>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s brainstorm a little bit. Look back at the RNA-seq workflow figure above and let&#8217;s suggest a few places where things could potentially affect the output dataset.</p>
<p>Here are a few thoughts...</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>How could the random priming step affect downstream results?</li>
<li>How could RNA secondary structures affect the library preparation process?</li>
<li>Would GC content be a problem?</li>
<li>Could gene length cause issues?</li>
<li>What might happen if you have genes with substantially different expression levels?</li>
<li>During the cluster generation on the Illumina flow cell, what might happen if you have too few clusters? Too many?</li>
<li>How is it possible to sequence many samples at one time?</li>
<li>What if you run out of reagents from one kit and have to open another kit to finish the library preparation process?</li>
<li>Could sequencing depth be an issue?</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So now that you may be questioning the validity of any RNA-seq dataset, take heart! Many very smart people have thought about these issues and come up with ways to assess technical artifacts and correct for them. So again, let&#8217;s brainstorm some potential solutions to these problems. Which problems can be addressed through better chemistries/processes vs. mathematical/computational correction?</p>
<p>These sorts of issues should always be considered, but recognize that RNA-seq is becoming fairly commonplace and solutions to many of these questions exist. Be critical of your data and <em>always</em> look at the raw data.</p>
<p>Multiplexing the sequencing process by pooling several samples together is not only cheaper, it can overcome what are known as <em>batch effects</em>. Batch effects are when you have samples that correlate with one another based on batch/time/etc. instead of biological replication. This is a very real phenomenon and can be caused by using different lots of the same kit/flow cells when preparing samples! You can correct for this, but we will get there later... For now, have a look at the diagram showing how multiplexing is achieved.</p>
<img alt="Multiplexing samples diagram" class="align-center" src="_images/multiplex.jpg" />
<p><em>From: http://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/sequencing_introduction_microbiology.pdf</em></p>
<p>This is an example of what a <em>batch effect</em> looks like. Note how DMSO1 and ETZ1 group together and DMSO2 and ETZ2 group together (e.g. by batch).</p>
<img alt="Batch effect example" class="align-center" src="_images/batcheffect.jpg" />
<p>We can determine what is considered a &#8220;good&#8221; base call from a &#8220;bad&#8221; one through using what is known as the Phred scoring system or Q-score.</p>
<p>Where Q is defined as a property that is logarithmically related to the base call error probability:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">Q = -10 \log_{10} P\ |\ error\ probability = P^2</span></p>
</div><p>So this means:</p>
<img alt="Phred scoring table" class="align-center" src="_images/basecall.jpg" />
<p><em>From: http://res.illumina.com/documents/products/technotes/technote_q-scores.pdf</em></p>
<p>Illumina tends to output sequence results with a Q &gt; 30. So let&#8217;s have a look at what some raw data looks like in terms of Q-scores before and after trimming adapters and low quality reads.</p>
<img alt="Raw vs trimmed alignment" class="align-center" src="_images/rawvstrimmedalign.jpg" />
<p>This is why we do the trimming before attempting to align the reads to the reference genome. Since we are using FastQC, let&#8217;s have a look at some sample data of what <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/good_sequence_short_fastqc.html">good Illumina data looks like</a>.</p>
<p>So, we have come to the end of the background section. Even with all of the great tools and chemistries that have been developed to handle RNA-seq datasets, the old mantra still applies: <em>garbage in; garbage out</em> and <em>with great power comes great responsibility</em>. Take care in analyzing these sorts of data as they typically influence many downstream experiments.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s rename the data file you just downloaded! First, we need to initiate a naming convention for the data. Having a consistent and meaningful naming convention for your data will make it much easier for you and anyone else attempting to work with your data.</p>
<p><strong>We have four conditions:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><em>L. reuteri</em> grown in LB</li>
<li><em>L. reuteri</em> grown in the presence of indole</li>
<li><em>L. reuteri</em> grown in the presence of commensal <em>E. coli</em> conditioned medium</li>
<li><em>L. reuteri</em> grown in the presence of EHEC conditioned medium</li>
</ol>
<p>For <em>L. reuteri</em> grown in LB, we will name our raw data files as <strong>LRWT1.fastq.gz</strong>, <strong>LRWT2.fastq.gz</strong>, <strong>etc.</strong></p>
<p>For <em>L. reuteri</em> grown in the presence of indole, we will name our raw data files as <strong>LRindole1.fastq.gz</strong>, <strong>LRindole2.fastq.gz</strong>, <strong>etc.</strong></p>
<p>For <em>L. reuteri</em> grown in the presence of commensal <em>E. coli</em> conditioned medium, we will name our raw data files as <strong>LRcomm1.fastq.gz</strong>, <strong>LRcomm2.fastq.gz</strong>, <strong>etc.</strong></p>
<p>For <em>L. reuteri</em> grown in the presence of EHEC conditioned medium, we will name our raw data files as <strong>LRehec1.fastq.gz</strong>, <strong>LRehec2.fastq.gz</strong>, <strong>etc.</strong></p>

<div class="section" id="logging-into-and-transferring-files-to-the-msu-hpcc">
<span id="logintohpcc"></span><h2>Logging into and transferring files to the MSU HPCC<a class="headerlink" href="#logging-into-and-transferring-files-to-the-msu-hpcc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are multiple ways with which you can access the HPCC and transfer files to the iCER machines. This overview will be from a GUI standpoint. If you would like to get fancy and learn the Linux/Unix commands, you can access the examples on the HPCC wiki <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/hpccdocs/Transferring+Files+to+the+HPCC">here</a>. Any other questions you may have not detailed here (which is a lot...) on how to use the HPCC more effectively, you can check out the user manual <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/hpccdocs/HPCC+Basics">here</a>. There are even videos of examples on how to use various software packages.</p>
<p><strong>Mac users:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open the terminal by going to Finder -&gt; Applications -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Terminal (might just be worth dragging it onto your dock).</p>
<img alt="Navigate to terminal on a Mac" class="align-center" src="_images/mactermnav.jpg" />
<p><strong>2.</strong> Type: <strong>ssh YourMSUNetID&#64;hpcc.msu.edu</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> You will then be prompted for your MSU NetID password. As you begin to type, the cursor will not show that you are entering characters, but you are. Hit the Enter/Return key at the end and you will be logged in. If this is the first time accessing the HPCC, it will send you a warning about not recognizing the RSA fingerprint. Type <strong>yes</strong> or <strong>y</strong> or whatever it needs to continue. It is okay, and necessary, to say you trust iCER to use the HPCC at MSU. If you are uncomfortable with any of this, utilize a lab or MSU computer.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> As an example of <strong>Step 3.</strong>, for me it would be <strong>&gt; ssh john3434&#64;hpcc.msu.edu</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Once you are logged in, it should look something like this:</p>
<img alt="HPCC log in screen" class="align-center" src="_images/hpcclogin.jpg" />
<p><strong>6.</strong> Congratulations! You&#8217;ve logged in. Let&#8217;s make a new folder here in anticipation of putting the data into it. Let&#8217;s call it <strong>RNAseq</strong>. Please don&#8217;t add any spaces. If you aren&#8217;t sure how to make a new folder, scroll up a bit to the <a class="reference internal" href="#basic-unix-coms"><em>Basic Linux/Unix commands</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> To <strong>log out</strong>, type: <strong>exit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows users:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> I am going to take the easy way out and <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/hpccdocs/Video+Tutorial+-+Putty">here</a> is a video on how to install an ssh client on Windows.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Congratulations! You&#8217;ve logged in. Let&#8217;s make a new folder here in anticipation of putting the data into it. Let&#8217;s call it <strong>RNAseq</strong>. Please don&#8217;t add any spaces. If you aren&#8217;t sure how to make a new folder, scroll up a bit to the <a class="reference internal" href="#basic-unix-coms"><em>Basic Linux/Unix commands</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> To <strong>log out</strong>, type: <strong>exit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Transferring files from your machine to the HPCC using FileZilla</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> If you haven&#8217;t already downloaded and installed <a class="reference external" href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla,</a>, please do so. We want to download the <strong>FileZilla Client</strong> and <em>not</em> the server version.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Open the application and then we will need to input a few things to get connected to the MSU HPCC.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Host: hpcc.msu.edu</li>
<li>Username: Your MSU NetID</li>
<li>Password: Your MSU NetID password</li>
<li>Port: 22</li>
<li>Click <strong>Quickconnect</strong></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Now that you are connected, you can move files from your computer (red circle) to the MSU HPCC (green circle) and vice versa, simply by double clicking the file. The connection closes if you exit out of the application.</p>

<div class="section" id="trimmomatic">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Trimmomatic<a class="headerlink" href="#trimmomatic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Trimmomatic is a lightweight java application that can remove Illumina adapter sequences and low quality reads. It uses a sliding window to analyze chunks of each read, examining the quality score, minimum read length, if it corresponds to an adapter sequence, etc. Let&#8217;s have a look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic">documentation</a> to see what each option does.</p>
<p>To run this application, you have to run it from the command line (e.g. the terminal). If you are a Windows user, you might find it easier to use the Powershell instead of the default command line. To see if you have Powershell, search your computer for it. It recognizes most of the commands listed above whereas the normal Windows terminal does not.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Navigate to your desktop by typing: <strong>cd ~/Desktop</strong> and hit the Enter/Return key. This should bring you to your desktop directory.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Type: <strong>ls</strong> to list the contents of your Desktop directory. Check and make sure that you have your raw data file (that has since been renamed) and the Trimmomatic directory that we put there previously.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Navigate to the Trimmomatic directory by typing: <strong>cd</strong> Trimmomatic and then hit the Tab key. This should auto-complete the name of the directory for you. Tab auto-complete is fantastic for filling in the name of a file for you if you don&#8217;t remember the exact name. Pretty neat, huh?!</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Now, let&#8217;s make sure you have Java installed. Type: <strong>java</strong> and hit Enter/Return. The result should be a list of commands trying to help you use Java. If you get an error, let me know.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> At this point, let&#8217;s try and trim your data file.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Copy and paste this into your terminal: java -jar ~/Desktop/Trimmomatic-0.32/trimmomatic-0.32.jar SE -phred33 ~/Desktop/NameOfSample.fastq.gz ~/Desktop/NewFileNameForTrimmedSample.fastq ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-SE.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36</p>

<p class="last">Read through this command and change the portions that say <strong>NameOfSample.fastq.gz</strong> and <strong>NewFileNameForTrimmedSample.fastq</strong>. <strong>DO NOT ADD SPACES IN YOUR FILE NAMES</strong></p>
</div>
<p>To continue our naming convention please name the <strong>NewFileNameForTrimmedSample.fastq</strong> as the following:</p>
<p>For <em>L. reuteri</em> grown in LB, we will name our raw data files as <strong>trimmedLRWT1.fastq</strong>, <strong>trimmedLRWT2.fastq</strong>, <strong>etc.</strong></p>
<p>For <em>L. reuteri</em> grown in the presence of indole, we will name our raw data files as <strong>trimmedLRindole1.fastq</strong>, <strong>trimmedLRindole2.fastq</strong>, <strong>etc.</strong></p>
<p>For <em>L. reuteri</em> grown in the presence of commensal <em>E. coli</em> conditioned medium, we will name our raw data files as <strong>trimmedLRcomm1.fastq</strong>, <strong>trimmedLRcomm2.fastq</strong>, <strong>etc.</strong></p>
<p>For <em>L. reuteri</em> grown in the presence of EHEC conditioned medium, we will name our raw data files as <strong>trimmedLRehec1.fastq</strong>, <strong>trimmedLRehec2.fastq</strong>, <strong>etc.</strong></p>
<p>Adding the word <strong>trimmed</strong> in front of the filename is important for the alignment steps done in Bowtie.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> After you&#8217;ve added the appropriate file names into the command, hit Enter/Return. It will run for a little while and then produce some output like this:</p>
