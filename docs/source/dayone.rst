===========================================================

Before moving forward to mapping reads to the genome, it is necessary to QC the reads and remove low quality reads and adapter sequences. Further we need the ability to perform differential gene expression between conditions. We have chosen to do this through several software packages. Below are some instructions on how to install them.

Software to install:

Trimmomatic
-----------

Trimmomatic is a commonly utilized tool for QC/trimming short reads and has been implemented in RNA-seq approaches in the literature and is the go to tool at the MSU sequencing facility (RTSF).

Trimmomatic can be downloaded from `here <http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic>`.

Scroll down the page (which you can read at your leisure later if you are interested) to where it says "Download Trimmomatic"

Click on the link that says "binary"
